## RECOMMENDATIONS

**Choose PRIORITIZED if:**
- You want maximum experiences
- Child has high energy levels
- You don't mind a moderately busy pace
- You want to see as much as possible
- You're okay with getting wet on Jurassic Rapids

**Choose TRIMMED/RELAXED if:**
- You prioritize stress-free enjoyment
- Child tires easily or needs flexibility
- You want generous buffer time between activities
- You prefer quality over quantity
- You want to avoid getting wet

**My Personal Recommendation**: Start with PRIORITIZED and adjust on-the-fly based on child's energy. The schedule is flexible enough to skip activities if needed.

## NEXT STEPS
1. Review both itineraries above
2. Choose which version(s) to implement as full HTML route maps
3. I'll create the HTML file(s) with photos, maps, and all details
4. Both will match Day 1's beautiful format and styling

Which version would you like me to create first, or should I create both?
